This repository contains some code to answer this question I was asked:

```
Tori has a maths problem none of us can solve. You start with 6 numbers-1,2,5,6,7,11 add each
consecutive number together to form the row above-do that with the next row until you form a
triangle with 200 at the peak. Can Janis solve it for us.

Example
      167
     70  97
   28  42  55
  10 18  24  31
 3  7  11  13  18
1  2  5   6  7  11
```
